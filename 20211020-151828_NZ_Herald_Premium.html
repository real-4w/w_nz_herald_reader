Rahul Bhattarai is a business reporter focusing on retail, small business The business community has expressed support for the National Party's Covid recovery plan released today.   Steve Gillett,
owner of popular sports bar and restaurant The Kingslander near Eden Park, said he was "totally" supportive of   any plan that gets people back into hospitality venues.   The National Party called for
an immediate boost in support for smaller businesses, for every vaccinated person to be given a $100 voucher to spend on tourism venues or eateries, as well as temporary tax cuts for workers and for
small businesses in its Covid-19 economic plan. They would target those on lower incomes in particular, by moving the threshold for paying the 10.5 per cent income tax rate up from $14,000 to $17,000
– a step it says would give every worker a bit more cash in their pocket and put more money back into the economy. National said a 24-month tax cut to 17.5 per cent for small businesses will help the
163,000 small businesses in New Zealand recover. The uncertainty of opening has been psychologically draining, and certainty was needed, Gillett said. He said National had a good idea to target
hospitality to help out by giving people an incentive like vouchers and it would definitely get them eating out again. "I think that's a brilliant idea, [I am] very for that, it's a very positive
idea," he said. BusinessNZ chief executive Kirk Hope said National's economic plan covered the immediate Covid-19 situation as well as the next step of reopening the economy and they welcomed the
plan. He said the National Party's immediate focus is on providing more targeted and general support for business, including improved regulation and immigration settings. "Businesses are likely to
welcome this approach, given the burden of Covid lockdowns has impacted so severely on business. "Targeted support and compensation for losses would be a significant help to many, along with a freeze
on new regulations that add to the cost of business. "The second part of National's plan - covering vaccinations, border controls, and the reopening of the economy - will be well received by the
business [community]," Hope said. "National's plan includes more freedoms for people who are fully vaccinated and no more lockdowns or regional boundaries once New Zealand reaches 85 per cent
vaccinations or on December 1, whichever comes first. "A key feature of the plan is the commitment to trust and support businesses to manage their own Covid-19 risks, including practical help such as
providing businesses with saliva tests to conduct regular tests of staff," Hope said. Restaurant Association chief executive Marisa Bidois said National's policy had some sound ideas, many of which
the association had put before ministers in the last 12-18 months. "We agree that the absolute focus for business right now is immediate financial support for those businesses disproportionately
affected by the operating restrictions as well as a clear plan and targets for opening up again. "It's good to see National supporting our Dine and Discover initiative as well as the plan for extended
outdoor dining, two initiatives that we've spent some time developing. "These are practical solutions to get our businesses moving again," Bidois said. Owner of Le Chef Edouard Le Goff said he has
eight staff in his restaurant and he was definitely supportive of the National Party's policy on tax cuts on small businesses and $100 incentives to get the customers spending. "Any ideas to help
small businesses to recover is a good idea,"  Le Goff said. The chief executive of Auckland's Chamber of Commerce Michael Barnett said the National Party's response is a better balance of health and
economics and it recognised some of the failings and weaknesses that the Government had retained from last year. He said the certainty around vaccination and rental support would be welcome along with
the clarity on eligibility for wage subsidies. Retail NZ chief executive Greg Harford said retailers are crying out for additional support and solid movement on a number of issues. There are a number
of parts of National's proposed policy that would be positive for the sector. "It is really important that a date is set for when we start to open up, and that businesses are armed with legal
certainty around vaccinations, plus there is merit in [National's] proposals around additional targeted support for business, rent relief and tax," Harford said Viv Beck, chief executive of the
business group Heart of the City, said the National Party's plan was a "well-rounded" policy that covers all the key bases and supports heavily impacted sectors. "It was great to see a plan focused on
supporting small to medium business, heavily impacted sectors and getting back to business quickly," Beck said. "It incentivises vaccination, which is absolutely the right thing to do, and creates the
framework businesses need to be able to require staff and customers to be vaccinated." She said the financial impact on small to medium businesses, coupled with the mental distress of watching their
businesses collapsing were immense. "We hope the Government takes heed [of the National Party's policy] and delivers for business on Friday. "We haven't seen a costing for the financial support that
is proposed [by the National Party] but it will be well received by many. It covers the key issues that people have been raising and it's also good to see the stimulation offered by initiatives like
vouchers, which would get people out supporting impacted businesses," Beck said. Premium 4 minutes to read Premium Updated 5 minutes to read Premium 3 minutes to read Premium 5 minutes to read 3

restrictions for the at least two weeks. In Northland will move to level 2 at 11.59pm on Tuesday 19 October. The rest of New Zealand will remain at level 2. Rahul Bhattarai is a business reporter
focusing on retail, small business As Auckland braces for another two weeks of level 3 lockdown, hospitality groups say their sector needs more targeted financial support now and the South Island
needs to be dropped down to alert level 1. They did get a slither of good news in that Finance Minister Grant Robertson intends to announce an "enhanced business support" package on Friday. But the
mood will only have worsened among business owners in New Zealand's biggest city. With Auckland set to remain at the current alert level for the next two weeks, the Restaurant Association is calling
on the Government to urgently act on its eight-point proposal of ideas to assist hospitality. Restaurant Association chief executive Marisa Bidois said: "The Auckland hospitality industry continues to
be disproportionately affected by the pandemic and it is time that our Government recognised this by providing financial relief that is specific and targeted to our sector." "Wage subsidy and
resurgence support payments are not enough – our businesses are on the brink and something more must be done. "Whilst it's good to see Northland moving down the alert levels, we really do need to see
more support for those parts of the country operating under greater restrictions," Bidois said. In September, Bidois unveiled stage one of the "Future of Hospitality Roadmap" which focused on
reopening and sets out the immediate steps needed to support the full reopening of the sector over the short-term, in line with broader Covid-19 pandemic developments. In a submission to Robertson
then, the Restaurant Association put forward eight practical solutions to get businesses back on their feet. Among them is the industry's call for the Government to continue the wage subsidy in level
2, a continued "lockout subsidy", a one-off "reopening payment", and various vouchers and incentives to encourage customers to support their local businesses. Then Bidois said, stages two and three,
were still under review, and would focus on recovery and sustainability and outline guidelines for a profitable and sustainable hospitality business model. Quick Read Quick Read Prime Minister Jacinda
Ardern said Auckland will stay at level 3 with current restrictions that are already in place for the next two weeks at least. She could not say exactly how long Auckland would be at level 3 before
restrictions eased further. Hospitality NZ chief executive Julie White said the extension for level 3 in Auckland is another blow to the already battered Auckland operators who will have zero revenue
for a minimum of eleven weeks. She said the industry also pleads to the Government to move South Island to level 1. "Confusing, frustration and an urgent plea to Government from the hospitality and
accommodation to share the plan for South Island to move to level one," White said. "It was a relief for some businesses in Northland but frustration continues for operators from Waikato who will have
to wait till Thursday to hear if they will be able to trade over the long weekend. Business Chamber chief executive Michael Barnett said the only good news from today's Covid-19 announcement was that
Auckland would be hanging its hope on tailored support which the Government said they were going to be releasing on Friday. "To me, this is the only good news they've got," Barnett said. "The wage
subsidy has already proven that it was not going to be enough to save businesses and what we have seen is that there is many businesses out there who are just surviving in the sea of debt and are
desperate to get back to work" "And the reality is, this is just killing livelihoods," he said. Retail NZ chief executive Greg Harford said the brutal reality is that Auckland retail businesses
continue to face uncertainty with no end in sight. "Most retail businesses are operating with almost no revenue coming in, while fixed expenses mount up.  More Government support is desperately
required by businesses if they are to survive, and it is pleasing that the Government will announce a new support package on Friday.  Retail NZ hopes that package will be flexible with greater support
for those businesses that are suffering the most. "Aside from financial support, a clear commitment to dates for allowing businesses to re-open is important.  Businesses, employees and customers need
to be able to plan, and setting a clear date will create a sense of urgency for those still to be vaccinated. "All businesses also need certainty that they will not face a personal grievance from
disgruntled workers if the implement a toolkit of measures, including vaccine or testing requirements for employees.  An early announcement that this is happening will allow employers to help support
the vaccination effort even more than they are now." Premium 4 minutes to read Premium Updated 5 minutes to read Premium 3 minutes to read Premium 5 minutes to read 3 minutes to read Quick Read

Mark Mitchell OPINION:   At the Cabinet meeting today, the Government should finally make the decision even Chris Hipkins is acknowledging needs to be made. It's time to open the doors of MIQ and let
our people come   home.   Now, to be clear, I have a vested interest in this decision as I am currently in MIQ at the Four Points Hotel in Auckland and have been for the past six days. But the logic
of keeping double-vaccinated returnees in MIQ for 14 days no longer makes sense, especially when on a daily basis people with Covid in the community are given dispensation to isolate at home. In a
recent interview, Hipkins noted there was now a "fundamentally different risk profile" with Covid in the community, and most of the people in MIQ were Covid-free. With the rapid increase in community
cases, he also acknowledged MIQ capacity would soon be at breaking point, as those people are moved to MIQ facilities. As an aside, I would like to think they are being moved to facilities not housing
returning Kiwis, but the word "transition" was used when describing the changes being made at the Distinction Hamilton to house community Covid cases. It would be complete madness to bring community
cases into a normal MIQ facility as these are probably the only places on the North Island where it is highly unlikely that Covid is present. Hipkins himself has stated "most of the people in MIQ
didn't have the virus, but are taking up rooms that will be needed as more and more people catch Delta". My case is typical. To fly at the moment, I need to have received a clear PCR test within 72
hours of my flight. I then took another PCR test on arrival in New Zealand – day zero (clear), another on day three (clear) and another on day 6 (result not yet received). In addition, my partner
Charlotte and I are both double-vaccinated (Pfizer). In fact, the biggest risk of my catching Covid is likely to come from the increasingly bureaucratic and inept handling of travellers by government
agencies seeking to show they are controlling the process, because they inevitably end up mixing travellers or returnees from different countries either in airports or quarantine facilities.
Ironically, planes feel safe, not least because they are largely empty (27 people on our flight from Singapore and 22 on our flight from London). At Changi we were walked and trained from one end of
the terminal to the other, before repeating the journey some 30 minutes later to get back to the departure lounge we had walked past immediately after disembarking the plane from London. In between we
ended up in rows awaiting processing with poor social distancing, whilst other travellers from who knows where walked past with no control or segregation. At all points of the journey, paperwork is
checked and rechecked (often within a few metres) thus increasing interactions between people and increasing risk of infection. Quick Read Quick Read Quick Read Quick Read Don't get me wrong,
returnees should (at the moment) undergo a short period of MIQ. But if you are double-vaccinated and have a clear pre-flight, day zero and day three test, you should be able to go home to complete
your isolation. We could also introduce the traffic light system operated overseas which categorises countries according to their risk profile and testing capabilities, varying the required stay in
MIQ. As an added incentive to getting our people vaccinated, home isolation could also be dependent upon all eligible people at the property having been double-vaccinated themselves. A major incentive
to get their loved ones home for Christmas. This move would instantly free up more spaces in MIQ, potentially increasing the MIQ capacity by 300 per cent - from the current 3800 to more than 11,000
spaces a fortnight. Once Aotearoa New Zealand gets to the 90 per cent double-vaccinated target, these quarantine requirements could be eased further for double vaccinated travellers. As a first step,
this clearly makes sense and preserves controls whilst starting a process to reopen our country and reunite our families and whānau. These members of the team of five million and their families have
played their part, often at great cost to loved ones separated in some cases for years. Many have suffered the pain of missed opportunities to say goodbye and attend funerals, while others have lost
the chance to experience the joys of new births and have precious family time. It's time to follow the science, show leadership, compassion and kindness, and for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and
Minister Hipkins to let our people go (and come) home. •   Andrew Barnes is a businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder of Perpetual Guardian and is best known in New Zealand for championing
