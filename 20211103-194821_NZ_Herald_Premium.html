wireless competition from Spark and Vodafone  has centred largely on outmuscling the mobile competition for raw speed.   In June, it   the speed of its top   Hyperfibre product from 4 gigabits per
second (or 4000Mpbs) to 8Gbps - with Chorus shareholders told at last week's annual meeting that speeds of a head-spinning 26Gbps were on the way.   And in September, Chorus tripled the speed of its
entry-level fibre service from 100 megabits per second to 300Mbps, while holding it at the same price. Now, the network provider is attacking things from the other direction. Today, Chorus asked
retailers for their views on a proposed cut-price, low-speed UFB fibre plan. Tech commentator Juha Saarinen says the target appears to be the 4G and 5G fixed-wireless incursion from Vodafone and Spark
(and, to a lesser degree, 2degrees). But this time it's not raw speed but a budget price that's the hook. Chorus asks service providers for their opinions on a fibre plan that would offer so-so speed
- 40Mbps down and 10Mpbs up, or not that much faster than VDSL (the fastest type of copper plan), according to testing it quotes from Commerce Commission benchmarks taken by independent tester
SamKnows. Although much slower than other fibre plans, it will still offer enough bandwidth for multiple family members to stream Netflix to different devices at once. Latency (or lag with two-way
connections) would be a crisp 3ms, or an edge over fixed-wireless. Quick Read Quick Read Quick Read Quick Read But the wholesale price would be just $39.00 per month - providing ISPs sell plans based
on the proposed 40/10 fibre service for $63.00 per month or less. ISPs who pocked effectively pocketed some of the saving by charging more than $63 would see the wholesale price bumped up to $44.20.
"We heard during consultation that a low-speed plan should cater to the more price sensitive customer segment, and we want to ensure the reduced costs of such an offer are passed through," Chorus told
providers. It added that the proposed plan is "designed for those customers who are not focused on high speeds but value reliable low-latency connectivity." Chrous spokesman Steve Pettigrew told the
Herald, "We believe consulting with broadband providers on our future fibre plans is pragmatic, and good practice. We are keen to hear their thoughts on the proposed plan as it will lead to better
decisions and, ultimately, a better product. It is worth noting that with this in mind the new plan may not be released in the form it is discussed in this consultation document." Chorus has shored up
its defence of fibre on several funds as the number of customers who have moved to fixed-wireless plans (which cut Chorus and its clip of the ticket out of the loop) has soared above 220,000. The
network provider has used both a carrot - in the form of a   for retailers who win back a customer who defected to fixed-wireless - and a taken a few pokes with a stick as it's asked the Commerce
Commission to investigate the mobile players' fixed-wireless marketing tactics (which recently resulted in a warning letter to all market participants). For their part, Vodafone and Spark have both
the price of their cheapest unlimited data 4G fixed-wireless plans to below $60 per month (with Spark's budget brand Skinny going as low as $35/month for a plan capped at 60GB), and both are expected
to push high-end fixed wireless plans harder as their 5G rollouts progress. With Chorus able to withdraw copper service in UFB fibre areas*, and just under 500,000 households still on copper lines,
the fibre vs fixed-wireless fight for their affection will only intensify over the next few months. Chorus shares were up 2.37 per cent to $6.47 in late trading on the NZX. The stock is down 23.64 per
cent for the year. * In legal terms, under the new regulatory regime, Chorus has had the right to rip out copper - or at least disable it - in UFB areas since September 1. But the Delta outbreak and
attendant lockdowns saw the network operator delay the first copper withdrawal to this month, then introduce a pause of at least seven weeks. In the meantime, Spark and Vodafone have   with their own
withdrawal of voice service over copper as Spark sunsets its PSTN technology, which is no longer supported by manufacturers. Premium 4 minutes to read Premium 4 minutes to read Premium 22 minutes to

the deductibility of interest costs on residential property investments. Video / Mark Mitchell Property editor, NZ Herald An Auckland developer says he may be forced to sell 85 city apartments due to
tax changes axing interest cost deductibility on loans for existing or built residential property investments.   Mark Todd, co-founder of Ockham   Residential, said the changes   by Finance Minister
Grant Robertson and Revenue Minister David Parker did not recognise that the build to rent sector already existed.   "It is odd that [Housing Minister] Megan Woods supports the BTR sector to provide
more new, warm, secure tenure properties but Parker is happy to kill off providers already delivering on Government policy," Todd complained. "I may be forced to sell 85 rental places worth $60
million to $80m if interest which is the main cost of owning these buildings becomes non-deductible," said Todd referring to apartments the company owns in Sandringham, Grey Lynn, Ellerslie and Mt
Albert. But Parker and Woods reiterated how changes did not affect new builds. "The Government has recently confirmed that new builds are exempt from the new interest deductibility rules to encourage
new supply including new purpose-built rentals," their joint statement in response to Todd said. "We know this sector has potential to meet gaps in our rental market and further advice will be taken
to Cabinet in the next few weeks on whether there should be an extension beyond the 20 year period for some or all of this sector," Woods and Parker said in response. The Herald has   how Woods is
seeking policy advice about encouraging the build to rent market. Todd said the Government wanted to eliminate mortgage interest deductions on loans for existing purpose-built rental properties which
would hugely disadvantage Ockham's existing build to rent city properties. Teachers and emergency service workers were among long-term tenants in those buildings but may have to find new homes if
Ockham sells, he said. Quick Read Quick Read The sales could become financially necessary when tax breaks are lost, he said. On one project alone, Ockham could lose a $500,000 mortgage interest tax
deduction, he said. He cited a $22m development 50 per cent geared via an $11m loan, incurring a $500,000 annually interest rate charge. If that project was new, the entire $500,000 could be claimed
back, he said. But if it was existing - as with the four Auckland blocks - no interest rate deductibility could be claimed, he complained. Ockham has loans on projects it developed but stands to lose
the tax advantages it holds there. Mortgage interest deductions will still be allowed on new builds to create more housing. Todd said reforms announced by Robertson and Parker delivered a strong
message that Ockham shouldn't consider retaining existing rental properties. It might well not be in its financial interests to do so, Todd said. Ockham's projects feature in Auckland Council's urban
design manual and it has deep iwi links. In July, the Ockham-Marutūāhu Partnership opened Kōkihi, the second apartment block in a 541-unit scheme. But Todd said: "Removing interest deductibility for
property investors is going to accidentally smother the build to rent sector which Labour says it supports. "The basic policy is good but there should be exemptions for build to rent, the same as rest
homes because they're not competing against homebuyers. If this doesn't happen, existing tenants will lose their homes because the owners will have to sell." The Government said it was working on a
policy to support build to rent to provide modern, warm secure tenure homes for the 40 per cent of Kiwis who rent, he said. "The most important thing they can do is fix this bill that does not
recognise the sector exists." Projects by Ockham, which sponsors New Zealand's annual book awards, were in July described by Woods as "exemplary". The new Auckland apartment building Kōkihi was
delivered ahead of schedule and an example of how to do great development, she said. "Exemplary developments" from the partnership were "instantly recognisable with their brick facades and motifs and
the next two will be equally impressive", she said of the under-construction Aroha at 1817 Great North Rd, Avondale and Manaaki at 9 Jordan Ave, Onehunga. Todd said the four Ockham buildings with
build to rent apartments are The Ockham on Sandringham Rd, The Isaac Buildings in Grey Lynn, Wamaka Buildings on Wilkinson Rd at Ellerslie and Modal in Mt Albert. In March, the Government announced
new measures to try to bring down property prices including tax deduction changes. In September, it released draft legislation on the policy proposing to limit the deductibility of interest costs on
residential property investments. Robertson said the interest limitation proposals aimed to stem investor demand for existing residential properties. They don't affect the main family home or new
builds. "Earlier this year we extended the bright-line test from five years to 10 to help reduce the incentive to invest in housing over other types of assets," Robertson said in September. "Tax is
neither the cause nor the solution to the housing problem, but it does have an influence, and this is part of the Government's overall response." Parker said the proposals, including the way the new
build exemption would be applied, had been subject to public consultation. The proposals would limit the availability of deductions for interest expenses incurred by landlords from October 1. The
legislation came into effect from then but is phased in during four years. The legislation is due to be passed early next year in time to be reflected in end of year tax returns. Shane Brealey of NZ
Living, which also develops build to rent places, said it wouldn't be right for corporates to keep the tax break but smaller investors not to. He understood why the Government was eliminating those
tax breaks to try to encourage more first-time buyers to be able to afford homes and discourage landlord investors from buying. Premium 4 minutes to read Premium 4 minutes to read Premium 22 minutes
