Mainfreight operates in 25 countries in five regions around the world. Photo / Supplied  In gratitude to its 10,393-strong global team for their efforts working under "unimaginable pressure" last
year, Mainfreight has published every one of their names in its new annual report.   The NZX-listed global logistics and transport   company reviewed another record financial performance - revenue up
47 per cent to $5.2 billion, profit before tax up 86.5 per cent to nudge $490m, net profit after tax 89 per cent stronger at $355m - but the overarching theme of its annual report was praise for its
team during "extraordinary" economic conditions and supply chain snarls in all five world regions it operates in.   Group managing director Don Braid paid tribute to "the wonderful efforts of our
people, whose entrepreneurial spirit has found solutions for our customers in what has been a difficult logistics environment". Chairman Bruce Plested, who for the eighth year running did not accept
the annual governance fee he's entitled to - $240,000 in FY22 - wrote that in Mainfreight's 45th year, most of the freight the company moves around the world, much of it 24/7, was required "on time".
"... We have a company-wide passion to achieve, and achieve and keep on achieving. That is perhaps the most important way in which we retain our existing customers and grow our business," said the
company's founder. Mainfreight paid a FY22 discretionary bonus totalling $94.2m to its team, up 114.7 per cent on the previous year. Thanking the team for rising to the challenges of "extraordinary
times", the annual report said "with everyone working under unimaginable pressure at times, you've made the impossible, possible", going on to fill 15 pages with their names. Director fees did not
increase from $120,000 in FY22, but Braid's remuneration rose by  $779,917, from $2.59m in FY21 to $3.37m. This comprised base salary of $2.5m, up from $1.8m in 2021; a discretionary performance bonus
of $806,080 ($726,163) and vehicle and other non-cash unchanged at $67,347. Last year due to Covid, Braid's base salary was paid at 50 per cent of the normal rate from April 12020 to September 30
2020. | The report said the discretionary performance bonus related to the previous financial year based on that year's revenue and profit growth, as well as other quality KPIs. A minimum of 33.3 per
cent of base salary was payable. There were no other short or long-term incentives. Last year director fees were also paid at 50 per cent of the normal rate from April 1 2020 to September 30 2020 due
to pandemic uncertainty. Noting Mainfreight's "successful formula" of giving autonomy to brand managers and leadership teams, and promoting leaders internally as retirement or other changes occur,
Braid, 62, said "the same process will follow for succession to the group managing director role - when that time comes". A 45-year veteran in the freight industry, Braid has been 28 years at
Mainfreight. He was appointed to the board in 2000. Chair Plested, 80, has been 44 years with the company. Braid repeated his annual result caution that the company did not expect the FY22 quantum of
profit improvement to reoccur in the short term. "Rather we anticipate we will revert to our normal levels of revenue and profit growth." A key objective was to intensify Mainfreight's network of
facilities within cities and across and between countries and regions, he said. "Continuing growth has meant we require more and larger facilities, and to this end, our capital expenditure will be
approximately $540 million over the next two years, of which $450m will be for land and buildings. "We will also add a further 54 leased facilities to assist the growth of the network." Capital would
continue to be invested to support growth aspirations, Braid said. "We expect similar levels fo investment in land, buildings and technology well into the future." Premium Updated Premium Premium

At home, she is losing her shine - NZ Herald | 7 mins to read Share this article Reminder, this is a  Premium  article and requires a subscription to read. Prime
Minister Jacinda Ardern appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Photo / CBS   Abroad, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand remains a leading liberal light. During a recent trip to the
United States, she delivered the commencement address at Harvard University, cracked jokes with Stephen Colbert and   met in the Oval Office with President Joe Biden. At each stop, she highlighted her
successes in passing gun restrictions and handling the pandemic.   At home, Ardern's star is fading. Rising prices for food, fuel and rent are making life increasingly difficult for many New
Zealanders, and an explosion of gang violence has shocked suburbanites not used to worrying much about their safety. More fundamentally, there are deepening doubts that Ardern can deliver the
"transformational" change she promised on systemic problems, as housing prices reach stratospheric levels, the country's carbon emissions increase despite her Government's pledges, and child poverty
rates stay stubbornly high. Polls show her centre-left Labour Party at its lowest level of support in five years, with an election looming in 2023. That, said Morgan Godfery, a liberal writer and
senior lecturer in marketing at Otago University in Dunedin, reflects a view that Ardern is "missing in action" on the issues voters care about. "New Zealanders who see this day to day are getting
frustrated by a lack of change," Godfery said. "But if you look from overseas, you don't see the lack of policy, you see the personality. And that's where the mismatch comes in." Ardern built an
international profile as a progressive feminist and a compassionate leader, which stood out all the more as a wave of right-wing populism swept the United States and other countries. It has allowed
her to amass unusual star power for the leader of a small country. In her first term, she won widespread praise as she guided her country through the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque massacre and
through the emergence of the pandemic. Within days of the mosque shootings, she announced a sweeping ban on military-style weapons. And after the arrival of the coronavirus, she took swift action to
eliminate the virus through lockdowns and border controls, largely preserving normal life. Her pandemic success helped lift her party to an outright majority in Parliament during the last election, in
October 2020 — the first time any party had won a majority since the country moved to its current electoral system in 1993. But it may also be causing her current troubles. As New Zealand emerged from
the pandemic with one of the world's lowest death rates, "there was a sense the Government really can do the impossible by holding up a virus ravaging the rest of the world", said Ben Thomas, a
conservative commentator. Now, with most of its virus restrictions lifted, Ardern's Government has lost its unifying fight against the pandemic and, with it, much of its bipartisan support. What
remains is soaring inflation, increasing gun violence and little progress on issues that have bedevilled New Zealand for decades. | | "The prime minister has gone from untouchable — almost Olympian —
levels back to being an ordinary politician again," Thomas said. Ardern, 41, is one of many world leaders whose support has fallen amid the economic snarls caused by the war in Ukraine and pandemic-
related supply chain problems. Biden's approval ratings are in the low 40s, and President Emmanuel Macron of France lost his party's parliamentary majority in an election marked by frustration with
the cost of living. New Zealand's inflation rate of 6.9 per cent is lower than the 9.2 per cent in the developed world as a whole, and Ardern has responded to criticism by pointing to the global
pressures beyond her control. "The whole world is experiencing the worst economic shock since the Great Depression, with the war in Ukraine and Covid-19-related supply chain issues adding to it with
the worst inflation spike in decades," said Andrew Campbell, a spokesperson for Ardern. Her Government has announced, among other measures, a payment of $350 to middle- and low-income New Zealanders
to help alleviate increases in the cost of living. Many, however, see the Government's responses as inadequate and are dissatisfied by overseas comparisons. "It's not the Government's fault, but it is
the Government's problem," Thomas said. Ardern has also found herself grappling with rising gun violence, with at least 23 gang-related drive-by shootings reported in late May and early June as two
once-allied gangs battled over territory. At times, police officers, who are typically unarmed in New Zealand, were forced to carry rifles in parts of Auckland, the country's largest city. Last week,
Ardern demoted her police minister, saying she had lost "focus". Ardern's difficulties are the latest twist in an unexpectedly rapid political ascent. After her sudden elevation to the Labour
leadership in 2017, her party rode a surge of "Jacindamania", fuelled by her fresh face and promises of major reform, to form a Government with two smaller parties in an upset victory over the centre-
right National Party. Three years later, in the next national election, 50.01 per cent of voters supported Labour. Until February of this year, polling showed the party still winning the support of up
to 50 per cent of voters. That month, the Government began loosening coronavirus restrictions. With the pandemic fading as an issue, Labour is now averaging 35 per cent support in polls, and the
National Party stands at 40 per cent. Including their allied parties, the two sides are evenly matched in polling. Political analysts are unsure whether Ardern can achieve breakthroughs on any of the
long-standing issues to help improve her standing. Successive governments have failed to rein in an overheated housing market. The problem has intensified under Ardern's Government, with average home
prices rising 58 per cent from 2017 to 2021. Last year, the average home price passed $1 million. The country has also battled persistent child poverty, which causes rates of rheumatic fever and lung
ailments that are surprisingly high for a developed country. In 2017, Ardern declared reducing child poverty a core goal. Currently, 13.6 per cent of New Zealand children live in poverty, a decrease
from 16.5 per cent in 2018 but more than the Government's target of 10.5 per cent. And despite Ardern's promise to treat climate change like her generation's "nuclear-free moment", emissions have
increased by 2.2 per cent since 2018. Campbell said the government had made progress on major issues despite Covid's challenges. "We have got on with addressing the long-term challenges our country
has faced, including overseeing the largest government housing programme in decades, lifting tens of thousands of children out of poverty, and taking real climate action," he said. But Godfery, the
liberal writer, said Ardern had not gotten enough help from her team in translating her rhetoric into policy. Ardern "is a genuinely caring and compassionate person who has a deep commitment to issues
of inequality, climate change and child poverty", Godfery said. "But often that doesn't translate to a concrete policy programme." This article originally appeared in  . • Pete McKenzie is a
