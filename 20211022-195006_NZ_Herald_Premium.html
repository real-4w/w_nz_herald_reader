Business Reporter, NZ Herald Trust management company Perpetual Guardian will require both staff and visitors to be fully vaccinated before entering its offices.   The company, which employs around
250 staff, made the announcement via an email from chief executive   Patrick Gamble.   In the email, Gamble explains his reasoning before stating that the mandate will come into effect from November
30, 2021, at all offices around the country. An internal survey at the company showed that 95 per cent of staff are either fully vaccinated or would be within the coming days. Gamble said that he did
not make the decision lightly and considered a range of potential alternatives before determining that this was the right course of action. "We have conducted a risk-based assessment for all roles
within the group," he said in the email. "In all cases, our people are working in offices where they may mix with those who enter rest homes or healthcare facilities ... The risk of exposure and
transmission is high. We don't believe we can reasonably mitigate that risk through social distancing etc, even if we mandated mask-wearing etc in all offices at all times. "This is particularly true
where the virus (and rapidly evolving strains) will be with us well into the foreseeable future." The issue of mandated vaccines has been contentious, but a number of major New Zealand employers have
decided to roll out policies that require proof of vaccinations. PWC and Russell McVeagh are just some of the other firms to be rolling out strict vaccination requirements, while the Warehouse is
actively considering whether it should do the same. | Quick Read Quick Read Even within Perpetual Guardian, there were some staff who did not agree with a policy mandating vaccines. The email details
that nearly 20 per cent of staff at the firm did not support the move. "Obviously, there are many different views within this group, including among those who are vaccinated themselves but don't
believe it should be mandated for others," Gamble says. "Through consultation and discussions, we are aware some people have concerns about possible tyranny of the majority, or about personal liberty
and bodily integrity. "Those concerns have significant merit and should not be ignored. However, it is clear that the country and our communities are being severely damaged by the continued lockdowns,
and would be even further damaged if the virus were rampant, so those concerns need to be balanced against arguments of civic responsibility and public utility." Asked by the Herald what this meant
for staff who refused to get the vaccine, Gamble said they would have to work remotely but also conceded that this was not practicable long-term. "In the interests of honesty and transparency with our
staff, we wanted to be upfront and say we don't see working from home with zero office or client interaction as a viable long-term option within our business," Gamble said. "Eventually, it will impact
people's ability to do their job, and it is also unfair to ask those who are vaccinated to take a larger share of healthcare facility visits - and the potential risks those may involve - to allow us
to carry staff who are not prepared to vaccinate. "We will work through a careful consultation process with any such staff members." Perpetual Guardian runs branches in 16 locations around the
country. Under current level 3 lockdown conditions, staff and visitors cannot enter offices in Auckland and Waikato but in-person meetings are still possible elsewhere under level 2. The new rules
mean that any clients that visit the offices from 30 November will have to be vaccinated or resort to digital means of communication. Gamble said that Perpetual Guardian is in the process of setting
up its own procedures to ensure staff and visitors are vaccinated, but he's also open to using the Government's vaccine certificate system in the future. Perpetual Guardian's move coincides with the
Government's announcement today that it would be rolling out a traffic light system once DHBs hit a 90 per cent vaccination level. Under that system, New Zealanders will be given more freedoms but
this will largely be contingent on whether they are vaccinated or not. In a 10am press conference on Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urged New Zealanders to get vaccinated if they wanted to do
the things they love. 2 minutes to read Premium 4 minutes to read Premium 10 minutes to read Premium 7 minutes to read Premium 4 minutes to read Premium | Updated 5 minutes to read 3 minutes to read

restrictions for the at least two weeks. In Northland will move to level 2 at 11.59pm on Tuesday 19 October. The rest of New Zealand will remain at level 2. Rahul Bhattarai is a business reporter
focusing on retail, small business As Auckland braces for another two weeks of level 3 lockdown, hospitality groups say their sector needs more targeted financial support now and the South Island
needs to be dropped down to alert level 1. They did get a slither of good news in that Finance Minister Grant Robertson intends to announce an "enhanced business support" package on Friday. But the
mood will only have worsened among business owners in New Zealand's biggest city. With Auckland set to remain at the current alert level for the next two weeks, the Restaurant Association is calling
on the Government to urgently act on its eight-point proposal of ideas to assist hospitality. Restaurant Association chief executive Marisa Bidois said: "The Auckland hospitality industry continues to
be disproportionately affected by the pandemic and it is time that our Government recognised this by providing financial relief that is specific and targeted to our sector." "Wage subsidy and
resurgence support payments are not enough – our businesses are on the brink and something more must be done. "Whilst it's good to see Northland moving down the alert levels, we really do need to see
more support for those parts of the country operating under greater restrictions," Bidois said. In September, Bidois unveiled stage one of the "Future of Hospitality Roadmap" which focused on
reopening and sets out the immediate steps needed to support the full reopening of the sector over the short-term, in line with broader Covid-19 pandemic developments. In a submission to Robertson
then, the Restaurant Association put forward eight practical solutions to get businesses back on their feet. Among them is the industry's call for the Government to continue the wage subsidy in level
2, a continued "lockout subsidy", a one-off "reopening payment", and various vouchers and incentives to encourage customers to support their local businesses. Then Bidois said, stages two and three,
were still under review, and would focus on recovery and sustainability and outline guidelines for a profitable and sustainable hospitality business model. Quick Read Quick Read Prime Minister Jacinda
Ardern said Auckland will stay at level 3 with current restrictions that are already in place for the next two weeks at least. She could not say exactly how long Auckland would be at level 3 before
restrictions eased further. Hospitality NZ chief executive Julie White said the extension for level 3 in Auckland is another blow to the already battered Auckland operators who will have zero revenue
for a minimum of eleven weeks. She said the industry also pleads to the Government to move South Island to level 1. "Confusing, frustration and an urgent plea to Government from the hospitality and
accommodation to share the plan for South Island to move to level one," White said. "It was a relief for some businesses in Northland but frustration continues for operators from Waikato who will have
to wait till Thursday to hear if they will be able to trade over the long weekend. Business Chamber chief executive Michael Barnett said the only good news from today's Covid-19 announcement was that
Auckland would be hanging its hope on tailored support which the Government said they were going to be releasing on Friday. "To me, this is the only good news they've got," Barnett said. "The wage
subsidy has already proven that it was not going to be enough to save businesses and what we have seen is that there is many businesses out there who are just surviving in the sea of debt and are
desperate to get back to work" "And the reality is, this is just killing livelihoods," he said. Retail NZ chief executive Greg Harford said the brutal reality is that Auckland retail businesses
continue to face uncertainty with no end in sight. "Most retail businesses are operating with almost no revenue coming in, while fixed expenses mount up.  More Government support is desperately
required by businesses if they are to survive, and it is pleasing that the Government will announce a new support package on Friday.  Retail NZ hopes that package will be flexible with greater support
for those businesses that are suffering the most. "Aside from financial support, a clear commitment to dates for allowing businesses to re-open is important.  Businesses, employees and customers need
to be able to plan, and setting a clear date will create a sense of urgency for those still to be vaccinated. "All businesses also need certainty that they will not face a personal grievance from
disgruntled workers if the implement a toolkit of measures, including vaccine or testing requirements for employees.  An early announcement that this is happening will allow employers to help support
the vaccination effort even more than they are now." 2 minutes to read Premium 4 minutes to read Premium 10 minutes to read Premium 7 minutes to read Premium 4 minutes to read Premium | Updated 5

Mark Mitchell OPINION:   At the Cabinet meeting today, the Government should finally make the decision even Chris Hipkins is acknowledging needs to be made. It's time to open the doors of MIQ and let
our people come   home.   Now, to be clear, I have a vested interest in this decision as I am currently in MIQ at the Four Points Hotel in Auckland and have been for the past six days. But the logic
of keeping double-vaccinated returnees in MIQ for 14 days no longer makes sense, especially when on a daily basis people with Covid in the community are given dispensation to isolate at home. In a
recent interview, Hipkins noted there was now a "fundamentally different risk profile" with Covid in the community, and most of the people in MIQ were Covid-free. With the rapid increase in community
cases, he also acknowledged MIQ capacity would soon be at breaking point, as those people are moved to MIQ facilities. As an aside, I would like to think they are being moved to facilities not housing
returning Kiwis, but the word "transition" was used when describing the changes being made at the Distinction Hamilton to house community Covid cases. It would be complete madness to bring community
cases into a normal MIQ facility as these are probably the only places on the North Island where it is highly unlikely that Covid is present. Hipkins himself has stated "most of the people in MIQ
didn't have the virus, but are taking up rooms that will be needed as more and more people catch Delta". My case is typical. To fly at the moment, I need to have received a clear PCR test within 72
hours of my flight. I then took another PCR test on arrival in New Zealand – day zero (clear), another on day three (clear) and another on day 6 (result not yet received). In addition, my partner
Charlotte and I are both double-vaccinated (Pfizer). In fact, the biggest risk of my catching Covid is likely to come from the increasingly bureaucratic and inept handling of travellers by government
agencies seeking to show they are controlling the process, because they inevitably end up mixing travellers or returnees from different countries either in airports or quarantine facilities.
Ironically, planes feel safe, not least because they are largely empty (27 people on our flight from Singapore and 22 on our flight from London). At Changi we were walked and trained from one end of
the terminal to the other, before repeating the journey some 30 minutes later to get back to the departure lounge we had walked past immediately after disembarking the plane from London. In between we
ended up in rows awaiting processing with poor social distancing, whilst other travellers from who knows where walked past with no control or segregation. At all points of the journey, paperwork is
checked and rechecked (often within a few metres) thus increasing interactions between people and increasing risk of infection. Quick Read Quick Read Quick Read Quick Read Don't get me wrong,
returnees should (at the moment) undergo a short period of MIQ. But if you are double-vaccinated and have a clear pre-flight, day zero and day three test, you should be able to go home to complete
your isolation. We could also introduce the traffic light system operated overseas which categorises countries according to their risk profile and testing capabilities, varying the required stay in
MIQ. As an added incentive to getting our people vaccinated, home isolation could also be dependent upon all eligible people at the property having been double-vaccinated themselves. A major incentive
to get their loved ones home for Christmas. This move would instantly free up more spaces in MIQ, potentially increasing the MIQ capacity by 300 per cent - from the current 3800 to more than 11,000
spaces a fortnight. Once Aotearoa New Zealand gets to the 90 per cent double-vaccinated target, these quarantine requirements could be eased further for double vaccinated travellers. As a first step,
this clearly makes sense and preserves controls whilst starting a process to reopen our country and reunite our families and whānau. These members of the team of five million and their families have
played their part, often at great cost to loved ones separated in some cases for years. Many have suffered the pain of missed opportunities to say goodbye and attend funerals, while others have lost
the chance to experience the joys of new births and have precious family time. It's time to follow the science, show leadership, compassion and kindness, and for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and
Minister Hipkins to let our people go (and come) home. •   Andrew Barnes is a businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder of Perpetual Guardian and is best known in New Zealand for championing
